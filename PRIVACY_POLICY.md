# Privacy Policy for Pinterest Wizard

**Last Updated: [Enter Today's Date]**

Thank you for using Pinterest Wizard. This privacy policy explains what information is collected and how it is used.

### Information We Collect

The only information we handle is the text you voluntarily enter into the "Describe your pin's content" text box within the extension.

### How We Use Your Information

1.  The text you provide is sent securely to our server function, which is hosted on Netlify.
2.  Our server function adds a secure API key and forwards your text to the OpenRouter AI service to generate a title and description.
3.  The generated content is then sent back to the extension for you to use.

### Data Storage

*   We **do not** store, log, or save the text you enter on our server. The data is only processed momentarily to fulfill your request and is then discarded.
*   The generated title and description are saved **locally on your computer** using Chrome's storage feature. This is done so your content is not lost if you close the extension popup. This data is never transmitted to our server.

### Third-Party Services

*   **Netlify:** Hosts our secure server function.
*   **OpenRouter:** The AI service that generates the content.

We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer your personally identifiable information to outside parties.

### Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this privacy policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new privacy policy in this file.
